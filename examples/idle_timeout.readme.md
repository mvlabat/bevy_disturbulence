# Notes on idle_timeout example



* `Idle timeout` means if no packets received for the specified duration, we drop the connection.
* `Heartbeat` is a packet sent automatically, and discarded by the remote peer, if we have otherwise not sent anything for the specified duration. Heartbeat packets exist to prevent the other peer from idle-timeout dropping you.
* By default, there are no idle timeouts or heartbeats.
* Heartbeat packets are standard UDP packets (not turbulence messages) and as such may not arrive.


## Idle timeout, to drop inactive connections

Run the server with a 3 second idle-drop-timeout:

`env RUST_LOG=info cargo run --example idle_timeout -- --server --pongs 2 --idle-drop-timeout 3000`

```
2021-06-24 11:56:40,864 INFO  [idle_timeout] IdleTimeoutArgs { is_server: true, pings: 0, pongs: 2, idle_timeout_ms: Some(3000), auto_heartbeat_ms: None }

Run a client:

`env RUST_LOG=info cargo run --example idle_timeout -- --client --pings 3`

```
2021-06-24 11:56:45,040 INFO  [idle_timeout] IdleTimeoutArgs { is_server: false, pings: 2, pongs: 0, idle_timeout_ms: None, auto_heartbeat_ms: None }

2021-06-24 11:56:47,095 INFO  [idle_timeout] Got packet on [0]: PONG
```

Note that 3 seconds after the last PING was received by the server, it drops the connection. The client has no idea this has happened, because dropping a connection doesn't attempt to signal the remote peer.

If you restart the client now, after the server has dropped it, the client will be assigned a new `ConnectionHandle` and proceed as normal. 

## Making the client detect dropped connections

Set the same `--idle-drop-timeout` value on the client, and it will also get a `NetworkError::MissedHeartbeat` followed immediately by a `NetworkError:Disconnected`.

## Using heartbeats to keep connections open

If your higher level protocol doesn't guarantee messages will be sent frequently enough, you can enable auto heartbeats. Since they can be lost (plain udp packets), setting the heartbeat timeout to less than a half of the idle-drop-timeout gives you a second chance if the first heartbeat packet is lost.

Nothing is logged at the `INFO` level for heartbeats, but if you run a client like this at `DEBUG`:

`env RUST_LOG=info cargo run --example idle_timeout -- --client --pings 3 --heartbeat-interval 1000`

```

Note the following things:

* The server doesn't drop the connection, due to heartbeat packets the client sends.
* After the 3 ping/pong exchange, the time since last rx keeps increasing. This is because the server does not have heartbeats enabled, so isn't sending anything to the client.
* The last tx time is as much as 1500ms in some cases, even though we specified 1000ms for heartbeats. This is because the bevy system that checks for idle connections and sends heartbeats runs on a fixed timestep, defaulting to 0.5 seconds. This can be configured in the `NetworkingPlugin` like so:

```rust
pub struct NetworkingPlugin {
    /// FixedTimestep for the `heartbeats_and_timeouts` system which checks for idle connections
    /// and sends heartbeats. Does not need to be every frame.
    ///
    /// The `heartbeats_and_timeouts` system is only added if `idle_timeout_ms` or `auto_heartbeat_ms` are specified.
    ///
    /// Default if None: 0.5 secs
    pub heartbeats_and_timeouts_timestep_in_seconds: Option<f64>,
}
```
